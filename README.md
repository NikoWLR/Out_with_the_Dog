## What is Out-with-the-Dog
A GeoJson based offline routing app that searches and displays the shortest route between two points using vectorized GeoJson data from the Finnish National Land Survey and City of Turku. At the moment it's mainly a proof-of-concept but possible use cases are being actively worked on. Based heavily on Per Liedmans GeoJSON Path Finder (https://www.liedman.net/geojson-path-finder/)
## Usage
Run "Main.html". At the moment the app picks from a list of start and end points when the site is refreshed. Note that the route finding does not need an internet connection but for now, displaying the map itself does.
